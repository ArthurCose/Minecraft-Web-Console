This is a simple project I worked on to help a friend start and stop a Minecraft server running on my computer.

It should work with all versions of Minecraft and work with other programs as well as no part of it actually depends on Minecraft. The command server runs a startup command provided in run.sh and offers a button to start and stop the command, and a terminal to read output and provide input to the running process.

This is somewhat insecure as nothing is in place to stop some unauthorized person from accessing the interface.
